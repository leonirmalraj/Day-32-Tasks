# MongoDB ZEN_CLASS TASK



The "zen_class" database has collections for users, codekata, attendance, topics, tasks, company drives, and mentors. It stores information about students, code challenges, class attendance, topics taught, tasks assigned, company placement drives, and mentors. Several queries demonstrate retrieving data, such as finding topics and tasks in October, company drives within a date range, students appearing for placements, codekata statistics, mentors with mentee counts, and users with absent and unsubmitted tasks in a specific period.
